To use the analysis
-------------------
Navigate to the "heatmap" page. Replace the path to R with the 
appropriate path on your system. R versions 3.1.x or 3.2.x are
suggested. Set the dimension slider as desired (optional) and 
click the Refresh >> link. The heatmap at the left will update.
Instructions are similar for the "dendrogram" page.

To view the Data Function
-------------------------
Go to Edit > Data Function Properties in the main menu to open the 
Data Function Properties dialog. Click its Data Function tab.
Select a Data Function from the list and click the Edit Script button.
This shows the script, the input parameters, and the output parameters.
Click Cancel to return to the Data Function Properties dialog. Click the 
Edit Parameters button to see how the input and output parameters are
mapped to items in the Spotfire Analysis.

To import the Data Function from an *.sfd file
----------------------------------------------
From the Data Functions Properties dialog above, click "Register New".
Click the Import toolbar item at top, and navigate the the *.sfd file,
select it, and click Open. Click the Run toolbar item at top, and
map all the inputs and outputs. When finished, click OK. You can do
this in a different Spotfire Analysis; refer to the mapping in the
example file.

To run the data function in RStudio
-----------------------------------
Run RStudio with TERR. This is done by setting the R version in the 
RStudio Tools > Options dialog. See 
https://docs.tibco.com/pub/enterprise-runtime-for-R/3.2.0/doc/pdf/TIB_terr_Using-TERR-with-RStudio.pdf
for more details.
Open the file "[R] create_heatmap.R" or "[R] create_dendrogram.R"
in RStudio. In the section labeled "Start interactive configuration", 
update the value of rpath and set any other variables as desired. 
Run the script.
